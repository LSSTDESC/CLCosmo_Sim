# CLCosmo_Sim
Cluster cosmology analysis using DESC tools and simulations

- CL_COUNT_class_cluster_abundance: provides prediction for cluster abundance in the mass-redshift or proxy-redshift space, for binned or unbinned framework.
- CL_COUNT_class_likelihood: provides binned Gaussian, Poissonian and unbinned Poissonian likelihoods for cluster count cosmology.
- CL_COUNT_DATAOPS_cluster_abundance_covariance: provides estimator of cluster abundance covariance based on data.
- CL_COUNT_modeling_richness: module for implement mass-proxy relation.
- STAT_forecast: module for Fisher forecast.
